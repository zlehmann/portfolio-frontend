      <h1>Senior Environmental Scientist</h1>
        <p>I graduated from Unity College in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in
        Wildlife Conservation with a minor in Forestry. Since then I have been working as
        and environmental scientist and ISA certified arborist in the greater New York City
        area. Most of my environmental career has been spent restoring wetland habitats,
        conducting habitat evaluations, and modelling natural resources using GIS. </p>
