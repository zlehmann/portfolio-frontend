        <p>My dual passions for the environment and technology have taken
        me on some interesting journeys. I have spent the past 15 years working
        with wetlands and forested habitats all over the east coast. I have developed
        Unmanned Aerial System platforms for wetland re-vegetation surveys and
        created sea-level rise models using GIS software. Now after graduating from
        the Flatiron web-developer boot camp I'm looking to transition my career
        full time. </p>
