        <h1>Full-Stack Web Developer</h1>
        <p>In the summer of 2018 I decided that I wanted to transition careers. My experiences in the
        environmental sector had left me disenchanted with the industry and a lack of creativity in my
         day to day job had me feeling unfulfilled. I enrolled in the Flatiron program that September, and
         nine months later, graduated from the self-paced web development program. Now I spend my time
         building web apps and looking for the opportunity to transition to a full time job as a developer. </p>
