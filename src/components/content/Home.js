        <p>I am a software developer and senior environmental scientist with a passion for technology,
         the environment, and geospatial information
        systems (GIS). I am currently working as a data acquisition specialist working with water quality data and
        Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) imagery data to model infrastructure impacts on the environment. I am also
        currently using R and Shiny to build web interfaces for large water quality data sets, enabling government
        officials to analyze previously unwieldy data reports more easily and efficiently.</p>
