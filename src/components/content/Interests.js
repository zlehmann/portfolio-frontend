        <h1>Jack of All Trades</h1>
        <p>Anyone who knows me well knows I have many hobbies. From brewing my own beer,
        to building drones, to attempting to build a cedar strip canoe. I love learning
        how things work and how to make things. Over the years I've taught myself how to
        weld, work with wood, fly fish, and code. I'm always on the lookout for my next
        big obsession.</p>
